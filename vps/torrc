# The transparent proxy port should bind to a port you're listening on with the
# hidden service. If you would like to avoid cleartext communication in
# general, you could just go for :443 here
TransPort 46.246.28.219:80

# All the packets that arrive from outside our machine/network do so with the
# destination 46.246.28.219 - since we want to establish a connection with our
# hidden service, we're mapping that destination address to the .onion, which
# makes Tor forward all the packets to that hidden service

# The machine that acts as the transparent proxy for the hidden service is
# not anonymous anyway, so it makes sense to ./configure --enable-tor2web-mode
# to impove speed/latency
